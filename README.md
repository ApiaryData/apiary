## What Is Apiary?

Apiary is a **lakehouse for small compute**. It's designed to run on inexpensive hardware — Raspberry Pis, NUCs, old laptops — while scaling seamlessly to cloud compute. Users write data via Python, query via SQL, and the swarm distributes work across available nodes with no central controller.

### Key Features

- **🏡 Runs on Small Hardware**: Designed for Raspberry Pi and similar devices, not cloud-first systems squeezed onto small hardware
- **☁️ Object Storage as Truth**: Data lives in S3, GCS, MinIO, or local filesystem — nodes are stateless workers
- **🤝 No Node-to-Node Communication**: Nodes coordinate through the storage layer itself, eliminating distributed systems complexity
- **🔒 ACID Transactions**: Ledger-based transactions using conditional writes (like Delta Lake)
- **🐝 Biology-Driven Design**: Memory budgets, task sizing, and failure recovery governed by bee-inspired behavioral patterns
- **📊 SQL Queries**: Apache DataFusion powers SQL queries over Parquet files
- **🐍 Python Interface**: PyO3-based SDK with zero-copy Arrow interop
- **🚀 Zero Configuration Multi-Node**: Add nodes by connecting to the same storage bucket — no seed nodes, no tokens

## What Makes Apiary Different

1. **Small-compute-first design**: Not a cloud system squeezed onto a Pi, but a system designed for resource-constrained hardware that scales to the cloud.

2. **Object storage as coordination layer**: No consensus protocol, no gossip network, no node-to-node communication. Nodes coordinate through the same storage that holds the data.

3. **Biology-driven resource management**: Memory budgets, cell sizing, backpressure, and failure recovery are governed by bee-inspired behavioral patterns — not metaphors, but algorithms.

4. **Zero-configuration multi-node**: A second node joins the swarm by connecting to the same storage bucket. No seed nodes, no tokens, no mesh network setup.

5. **Solo to swarm without code changes**: A single Pi with local filesystem storage is a fully functional data platform. Switching to S3 and adding nodes is a configuration change, not an architecture change.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Pre-built Binaries (no build required)

```bash
# Linux / macOS (x86_64 or ARM64 / Raspberry Pi)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ApiaryData/apiary/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ApiaryData/apiary/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/apiarydata/apiary:latest   # or build locally
docker build -t apiary:latest .
```

#### Build from Source

**Prerequisites**: Rust 1.78+, Python 3.9+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ApiaryData/apiary.git
cd apiary
cargo build --workspace
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

### Hello Apiary

```python
from apiary import Apiary

# Solo mode (local filesystem)
ap = Apiary("my_database")
ap.start()

# Check status
status = ap.status()
print(f"Running on {status['cores']} cores with {status['memory_gb']:.2f}GB memory")

# Shutdown when done
ap.shutdown()
```

### Multi-Node Mode

```python
from apiary import Apiary

# All nodes connect to the same storage
ap = Apiary("production", storage="s3://my-bucket/apiary")
ap.start()

# Nodes automatically discover each other through the storage layer
# No additional configuration needed!
```

## Architecture Overview

### The Beekeeping Metaphor

| Concept | Apiary Component | Description |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Hive** | Database | Top-level logical grouping |
| **Box** | Schema | Namespace within a hive |
| **Frame** | Table | Queryable dataset |
| **Cell** | Parquet file | Physical storage unit |
| **Bee** | CPU core | Unit of compute (1 core = 1 bee) |
| **Swarm** | Compute mesh | All nodes and their bees |
| **Meadow** | Object storage | Where all data lives |

### Storage Model

```
Tier 1 — Memory: Arrow RecordBatches in bee chambers (active computation)
Tier 2 — Local Disk: Cache + spill + write buffer
Tier 3 — Object Storage: S3/GCS/MinIO/filesystem (canonical truth)
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Object storage is canonical**: All committed data, metadata, and coordination state lives in object storage
- **Conditional writes for serialization**: One write succeeds, the other retries — no Raft needed
- **1 core = 1 bee**: Each virtual core is an independent unit with its own memory budget
- **Biology is the runtime**: Mason bee isolation, leafcutter sizing, abandonment, and colony temperature are not metaphors but algorithms
